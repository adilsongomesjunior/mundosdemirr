|description = Provides an hierarchical namespace permissions system (aka "prefixes") to Mediawiki without changes to the base installation nor creation of new database tables.
|author = [[user:jldupont|Jean-Lou Dupont]]
}}
== Features ==
* Permission management through simple edition of a page
** <code>MediaWiki:Registry/HNP</code>
* Sysop has always all rights regardless of state of registry page
** Enables easier 'human error' management
* Prefix based namespace access with wildcards
** E.g. 'sysop group has access to all namespaces'
* Namespace dependant & Namespace Independant rights management
* No additional database tables nor changes to schema
* No mandatory patches
** Namespace dependant rights management: no patches necessary
** Namespace independant rights management: if wanted, requires a patch:
*** 'includes/User.php'
* Post-installation information always available through [[Special:Version]] page.
* Magic Words:
** ' #username# ' magic word can be used to substitute the current user's name in the title field
*** Useful for implementing functionality akin to 'KeepYourHandsToYourself' whereas only the owner of a userpage can edit his own

== Usage ==
Please see example configuration page [[{{FULLPAGENAME}}/Example|Example]].

== Notes ==

== User.php patch ==
=== Original file ===
<source lang=php>
	function isAllowed($action='') {
		if ( $action === '' )
			// In the spirit of DWIM
			return true;

		return in_array( $action, $this->getRights() );
	}
</source>
=== Patched file ===
<source lang=php>
	function isAllowed($action='', $ns = null /* addition */, $title = null /* addition */ ) 
	{
		if ( $action === '' )
			// In the spirit of DWIM
			return true;

		//  PATCH begin{{
		$result = null;
		wfRunHooks('UserIsAllowed', array( &$this, $ns, $title, &$action, &$result ) );
		if ( $result !== null )
			return $result;
		// PATCH end }}

		return in_array( $action, $this->getRights() );
	}
</source>

== MEDIAWIKI NOTES ==
1) Only the forward slash is interpreted (when enabled) as an
   indicator of "sub-page". Thus, only the forward slash and ~ are
   considered here to be part of the hierarchical functionality.
 
2) The allowed characters in a title are defined in "DefaultSettings.php".
   $wgLegalTitleChars = " %!\"$&'()*,\\-.\\/0-9:;=?@A-Z\\\\^_`a-z~\\x80-\\xFF+";
   NOTE that #{}[]| are not part of this list.
  
3) Special command characters for preg_match do not include the following:
   #`'~,@
   Those were tested with preg_quote

4) Be careful not to choose namespace name identifiers too long as the 
   standard limit in Mediawiki is 16characters long.  

== History ==
=== 1.0.1 ===
* Removed file caching (causing more troubles than adding value)
* Fixed debug messages as to not stop normal processing flow.
=== 1.1.0 ===
* Added Magic Words support
** '#username#' magic word for implementing functionality akin to 'KeepYourHandsToYourself' 
=== 1.1.1 ===
* Attempt at fixing the parser functions '#hnp_r' and '#hnp_h' that do not work on some setup.
=== 1.1.2 ===
* Reverted 'fix' of version 1.1.1
* Adjusted dependency to [[Extension:StubManager]] v1.0.5 (fix for PHP bug with version 5.1.2)
