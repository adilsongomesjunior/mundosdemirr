<p><font face="Arial" size="3">The number of web sites offering news &amp;
information using feeds is exploding! A feed is a regularly updated summary
of web content, along with links to full versions of that content. When you
subscribe to a given website's feed by using a feed reader, you'll receive a
summary of new content from that website right on your screen or in a
software feed reader. Many websites are using feeds to publish their latest
information right to thousands of users within minutes. Soon everyone will
be using them. This makes feeds the ideal place to advertise.<br>
<br>
More and more people are subscribing to feeds every day and there are
millions who are already subscribed.<br>
Thus, your ad will reach a very broad range of potential customers with
each use of Feed Blaster!<br>
<br>
Feed Blaster is the first &amp; only submitter that can submit your ads to
thousands of feeds within a few minutes!&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<br>
Post your ads where people read them!<br>
<br>
- What if you could place your ad into all these feeds ?<br>
<br>
Right, that would mean you would have millions of sites<br>
linking to your ad - and millions of users reading your message within
minutes - and my idea actually works.<br>
