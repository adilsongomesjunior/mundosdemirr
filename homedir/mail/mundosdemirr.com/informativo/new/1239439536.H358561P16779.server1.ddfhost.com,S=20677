      Children's cough and cold medicines have taken a justifiable beating in the past few years, and the news isn't getting any better (at least not for the

drug manufacturers). A recent study published in the medical journal Pediatrics suggests use of these medicines in children under age 6 may cause as many as

500 child deaths per year - strike three in the eyes of many concerned parents and health care providers who feel the potential dangers aren't worth the

risk.
      <p align="left">The first strike against cough and cold medicines came in 2006, when guidelines published by the American College of Chest Physicians

(ACCP) stated that over-the-counter cough and cold medicines are ineffective in treating the "underlying causes" of cough. The guidelines strongly

recommended against the use of such medicines by children ages 14 and younger. At the same time, a review in <i>Respiratory Physiology and Neurobiology</i>

attributed the perceived benefit of cold medicines to "the placebo effect," essentially suggesting parents (and their children) feel the medicine is working

because they have an underlying assumption it will work.
      <p align="left">Strike two came in 2008 - that's when the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a public health advisory recommending that

over-the-counter cough and cold products not be given to infants and children under 2 years of age because of serious and potentially life-threatening side

effects. The agency had received reports of deaths associated with decongestants and antihistamines in children, most younger than age 2. Pharmaceutical

manufactures complied, pulling products from the shelves. Approximately six months later, manufacturers announced they would voluntarily change their product

labels, this time to warn against giving cough and cold medicines to children ages 4 and younger.
      <p align="left">The FDA is in the process of deliberating whether to extend the ban on cough/cold medicines to children older than age 4; perhaps all

the way up to age 11. A decision is expected within months. With up to 500 children dying each year, isn't it about time? After all, three strikes and you're

out. Ask your doctor about the dangers of common child medications and potential nondrug alternatives.

      Over the years, various studies have suggested that people who regularly consume cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, brussels sprouts,

cabbage, turnips, bok choy, etc.) have lower rates of many cancers, including breast and prostate cancer. Researchers have investigated cruciferous

vegetables in an attempt to identify the active agent(s) that account for this cancer-protective effect. As it turns out, cruciferous vegetables are unique

in that they contain compounds called sulforaphane and indole-3-carbinol. Both of these natural agents enhance the body's ability to detoxify cancer-causing

chemicals, but indole-3-carbinol in particular exhibits other impressive anti-cancer effects that should be recognized.
      <p align="left">Experimental studies show that indole-3-carbinol and its metabolites (products made from indole-3-carbinol in the body's metabolism)

not only stop the growth of certain types of cancer cells, but also trigger them into committing suicide. This is an important mechanism by which the

indole-3-carbinol is thought to lower our risk of cancer.
      <p align="left">So, in addition to speeding up the body's ability to neutralize (detoxify) and eliminate cancer-causing chemicals, indole-3-carbinol

also appears to help ensure that any emerging cancer cells commit suicide before they can become a threat to the body. Research suggests supplementation with

indole-3-carbinol also reverses cervical dysplasia and vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (tumor), two precancerous conditions that occur in women, in a high

percentage of cases. Another study showed that indole-3-carbinol supplementation reversed respiratory papillomas as well.
      <p align="left">In addition to these impressive cancer-fighting capabilities, indole-3-carbinol also helps prevent the buildup of the form of estrogen

that is linked to breast and uterine cancers. Researchers have identified that when a woman's body makes more of one form of estrogen (16-OH estrone) and

less of another form (2-OH estrone), her risk of reproductive organ cancer is greater. Indole-3-carbinol promotes the conversion of estrone to 2-OH estrone,

the form of estrone that is safer and less potent, and reduces the buildup of the dangerous 16-OH estrone.
      <p align="left">Indole-3-carbinol may be one of the most powerful cancer-fighting nutrients ever identified. In order to derive optimal benefits from

this important compound, you should consume broccoli, cauliflower, brussels sprouts or some combination of cruciferous vegetables at least four to five times

per week. In addition, you should consider indole-3-carbinol supplementation to further optimize your cancer defenses on a daily basis. Talk to your doctor

about how to reduce your risk of developing cancer and other diseases through the proven power of nutrition.

      Flip through the television channels on an average day, especially first thing in the morning or late at night, and you'll see the latest, "greatest"

fitness routines, techniques and tools designed to sculpt your body. Do they work any better than the "old-school" methods people have been using

successfully for generations? Here's a time-tested fitness strategy that's been around for centuries and remains popular today among exercise enthusiasts

looking for simple, effective ways to get in shape: <i>kettlebells</i>.
      <p align="left">A <i>kettlebell</i> or <i>girya</i> is a traditional Russian cast iron weight that looks like a cannonball with a handle. Picture a

bowling ball with a handle on it. You can do standard weight training exercises with kettlebells: bench presses, military presses, rows and squats. However,

the unique value of kettlebells is derived from ballistic (fast exercise) work: snatches, swings, cleans and jerks. Consistent kettlebell exercises can be

used to improve physical appearance, enhance cardiovascular health, decrease pain, prevent injury, reduce body fat, and increase lean muscle mass, strength,

endurance, flexibility and performance.
      <p align="left">Here is a short list of workout equipment the kettlebell can replace: barbells, dumbbells, belts for weighted pull-ups and dips, thick

bars, lever bars, medicine balls, grip devices, and cardio equipment. Two or three different-size kettlebells are all you need. When you first start using

kettlebells as a primary fitness tool, focus on exercises that provide the most bang for your buck. Break down a full-body workout into five categories: one

pressing exercise, one pulling exercise, one exercise for the quads, one exercise for the hamstrings and one core exercise. This ensures that the entire body

is getting a workout and prevents you from focusing too much on one area.
      <p align="left">For step-by-step instructions on how to complete a full-body workout using only kettlebells, visit <a

href="http://www.toyourhealth.com">www.toyourhealth.com</a>. Remember, always talk to your doctor before beginning any exercise program, particularly if you

have a pre-exisiting health condition.
