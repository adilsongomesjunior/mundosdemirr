<BODY><b>Thank you for your interest in the Mystery Shopper position.</b><BR>
Our company conducts surveys and evaluates other companies in order to help them achieve their performance goals.<BR>
We offer an integrated suite of business solutions that enables corporations to achieve tangible results in the marketplace.<BR><BR>
We get hired by other companies and act like customers to find out how they are handling their services in relation to their customers.<BR>
Mystery Shopping is the most accurate and reliable tool a business can use to gather information regarding their actual customer service performance at the moment of truth.<BR> 
This moment of truth is not when the staff is on their best behavior because the boss is around - it is when they interact with customers during their normal daily routines.<BR>
<BR>
This is where you, the Mystery Shopper, come in. <BR>
You pose as an ordinary customer and provide feedback of both factual observations (ex...the floor was free of debris) <BR>
and your own opinions (ex...I felt that the temperature in the establishment was too cold).<BR><BR>
Mystery Shoppers must remain anonymous. You must act as a regular customer and be careful not to do anything that would reveal you as a shopper. <BR>
An inexperienced shopper could tip off the staff to his/her identity by asking for the manager's name for no clear or appropriate reason. <BR>
If you are going to be bringing someone with you on the shop, make sure you educate them about the process as well. <BR>
Beware that even whispers can be overheard by employees. If anyone notices you are a shopper, <BR>
you can bet that word will quickly spread around the establishment and you will get some of the best customer service in town.<BR><BR>
No company can afford to have a gap between the promise of quality and its actual delivery, that's why leading corporations look to us, <BR>
the nation's premiere mystery shopping and customer experience measurement company.<BR><BR>
<b>In order for a business to effectively compete in today's economy, they must be prepared to meet the challenge of increasing sales by:</b><BR>
* Retaining existing customers<BR>
* Acquiring new customers<BR>
* Creating word-of-mouth advocacy<BR>
* Improving customer loyalty<BR><BR>
Once we have a contract to do so, you would be directed to the company or outlet, and you would be given <BR>
the funds you need to do the job(either purchase merchandise or require services), after which you would write a detailed report of your experience.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Examples of details you would forward to us are:</b><BR>
1) How long does it take to get served.<BR>
2) Politeness of the attendant.<BR>
3) Customer service professionalism.<BR>
4) Sometimes you might be required to upset the attendant, to see how they deal with difficult clients.<BR><BR>
Then we turn the information over to the company executives and they will carry out their own duties in improving their services.<BR>
Most companies employ our assistance when people complain about their services, or when they feel there is a need for them to improve upon their customer service.<BR>
Our company partners with you to implement proven mystery shop auditing and surveying strategies that provide critical information about customer experiences.<BR>
<BR>
<u>You will be paid a commission of $100 for every duty you carry out, and bonus on your transportation allowance.<BR>
Your task will be to evaluate and comment on customer service in a wide variety of restaurants, retail stores, casinos, <BR>
shopping malls, banks and hotels in your area.</u><BR>
<BR>
<b>Qualities of a good Mystery Shopper:</b><BR>
