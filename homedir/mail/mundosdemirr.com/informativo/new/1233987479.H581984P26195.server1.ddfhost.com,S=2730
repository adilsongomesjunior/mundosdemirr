<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Weblog or blog population is exploding
around the world, resembling the growth of e-mail users in the 1990s.<br>
<br>
Post your ads where people read them!<br>
<br>
- What if you could place your ad on all these sites ? Right, that would
mean you would have millions of sites linking to your ad - and my idea
actually works.<br>
<br>
I have developed a software that automatically places your ad on millions
of blogs.<br>
<br>
You will receive thousands of targeted hits to your website as Blog Blaster
places your ad on blogs that match your ad's category. This method has never
been released to the public before. Very few, if anyone has implemented
this.<br>
