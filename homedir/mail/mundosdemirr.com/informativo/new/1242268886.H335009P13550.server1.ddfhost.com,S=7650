rm session for how to prepare for what lies ahead. just sayin.


i always enjoy knitting lacy stuff but this pattern was especially fun, sup=
er easy, and portable.


i was chuckling while i cooked thinking about how my irish grandparents alw=
ays had a plaque on their wall with this prayer on it: "may you be in heave=
n a half hour before the devil knows your dead" ha!=20


may you always have courage to take a chance and never find frogs in your u=
nderpants.


i am looking forward to a date with grant.


wooohoooo!"=20

pping, elegant enough for church, cute enough for a tshirt...i really love =
this scarf pattern (gee can you tell?).=20


i am craving some sunshine.


really, cate is also mexican, japanese, native american, swiss, and a lot m=
ore- a true american- so we actually have a lot of family history travellin=
