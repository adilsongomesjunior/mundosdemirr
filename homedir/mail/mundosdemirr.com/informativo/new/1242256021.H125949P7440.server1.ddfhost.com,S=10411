at 18 i planned to live the tahoe hippie life forever one day i felt compel=
led i knew it i just had to leave i packed up my car and moved to the centr=
al coast=20


i will i will i will please hold me accountable if you dont see the results=
 posted next week the inspiration pieces


i have been laying in bed sick since monday it seems to be getting worse by=
 the day not better i am so irritated and antsy i miss my family and i want=
 to clean my house=20


the girl loves chocolate milk


it was the first time i realized that things dont always go how you think t=
hey will and that it all can turn out better than you imagined


women who have these hormonal issues typically carry alot of weight around =
the middle (due to the out of control insulin and resultant too high of tes=
tosterone) and a high protein and fiber diet combined with low carbs really=
 helps with that an added benefit is that these types of foods are so filli=
ng and you avoid the highs and crashes that people with blood sugar problem=
s live by


cate chose these pretty little traditional valentines cards from bunny cake=
s i love them


what do you look for in a best friend


i have never been an animal person i swore id never have a dog who wants to=
 pick up poop not me but somehow in my baby hungry weakness i was convinced=
 to relent by the other two mccalebs who said they desperately needed a pup=
py fine whatever just take care of her and pick up the poop


a conversation today


my problem dear anne is that it is 2009 kids dont like to get all fussied u=
p anymore and i dont think they would go to the trouble of making up storie=
s about lost broaches to be able to go to a silly church picnic in my mind =
the little girls are wearing spring dresses and holding parasols with their=
 gloved hands while the boys are eating biscuits and drinking homemade root=
beer with their hats and suspenders on but i live in a dreamland where i wa=
nt everything stylized i know you understand me anne


and that made me think of all the insomniatic nights that she stayed up wit=
h me and mirrored my every move and snuggled me right out of my anxiety int=
o dreamland long after grant and cate had drifted off


ten months after we were married i was a stay at home mom living the studen=
t life again while grant went back to school a few months later another unp=
lanned event- my mom passed away suddenly=20


feeling so inspired


goal peaceful nights productive days


but let me tell you thats not how it will really go i imagine most kids wil=
l want to stay home and play computer games but their moms will make them c=
ome and so theyll grudgingly put on a some church pants and skirts so i was=
 wondering if you could help me know how to bring the romance back into our=
 modern life its not really that important no matter the dress or the menu =
we just want the kids to come to feel the spirit of the temple but its like=
 you said anne when you dont use your imagination to make life beautiful ho=
w much you miss


i swear nothing makes me happier than a peaceful space and some needles=20


he is the perfect mix to me of blues and folk and funk and feeling=20


i am determined


i thought id live there forever one day when i was 12 my dad quit his job a=
nd we moved to lake tahoe it rocked my stable world=20
