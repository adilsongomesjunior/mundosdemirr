<br><br>Hello. 
<br>I have a pretty good and interesting life, a lot of friends, but I lack perhaps the most important thing - the man for me, who would become not only a lover, but a loving and caring man who will make my life more interesting and complete. 
<br><br>He should be intelligent and fun, be sporty and good looks. I am a beautiful, cheerful and kind woman. 
<br><br>I would say that I can be different: sweet and caring, stubborn and self-willed. I know what I want to achieve in my life, and I try to do my best. I like to do nice things for the people whom I love and always ready to support people who need my shoulder. 
Life made up of simple things, but I know how to do simple things beautiful and interesting. I am very sincere and I want to give my love to only one man
